Semantic HTML:

You used appropriate HTML tags like <section>, <header>, <p>, and <img>, contributing to semantic structure. This is good for accessibility and SEO.
Responsiveness:

Including meta tags like viewport in the <head> ensures basic responsiveness.
Dynamic Rendering:

The use of JavaScript to render dynamic content with template literals is clean and adheres to DRY principles.
Modularity:

The increaseLike function is isolated, which aligns with the principles of modular design.

HTML and Accessibility
Image Descriptions:

Ensure all alt attributes are descriptive and meaningful. For example:
html
Copy code
<img src="${posts[i].avatar}" alt="Profile picture of ${posts[i].name}">
ARIA Labels:

Include ARIA roles or labels for interactive elements like buttons or icons to improve screen reader accessibility:
html
Copy code
<img src="./images/icon-heart.png" alt="like icon" class="icon" role="button" aria-label="Like post">
Landmarks:

Use <main> for the main content section instead of <section id="render"> for improved accessibility.
